## 3D First-person Racing Physics Styles:
_Definition, ideas, examples and reasoning behind each of them_

1. Classic Defrag
- 1:1 classic VQ3 and CPM defrag gameplay
- Rulesets are kept intact, and tweaked to be as close as possible to the origina
- Has two leaderboards:
  1. CPM
  2. VQ3

2. Speed Physics
- Based around time-to-complete gameplay.
- Same gamemode as classic defrag, but with custom physics / weapons / powerups / etc
- Uses differential strafing as a core
- Classic gameplay feel, but with added complexity and mechanics

3. Tech Physics
- Oriented towards difficulty-to-complete gameplay.
- Allows/encourages time-to-complete, but to a lesser degree than the Speed Mode.
- Uses differential strafing as a core
- Explained more in depth in [this section]()

### Naming
#### Classic:
- Signals the player, already by its name, that the original defrag mechanics are supposed to be there and preserved as "classic" and intact as possible.

#### Speed:
- Contrasted with classic: Signals the player that a different ruleset from "classic defrag" is to be expected.
- Contrasted with tech: Signals the player that the gameplay is focused around going fast and beating a timer.

#### Tech:
- Contrasted with Speed: Signals the player that the gameplay is focused around technical movement and precision.
