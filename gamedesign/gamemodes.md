#### Racing mode:
- Time & Speed oriented mode (aka regular defrag)

#### Tech mode:
- Technical / Precision oriented mode.
- Defrag community sometimes references "tech" maps (like CS tech) by the name "trickmaps".

#### Freestyle mode
- Video reference of what's possible in Freestyle defrag: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYbQIsAtlnY
- Based on Freestyle Defrag trickjumping, combined with the "trick design" elements from tricksurfing (aka freestyle surfing).
- Physics are an optional selectable feature for each trick.
- Players who desing a trick can select the physics in which the trick should be performed.

Freestyle defrag is really fun, but it's underplayed because most people are not creative enough to come up with their own tricks. Specially when starting out in the game.

Having the same backbone as tricksurfing, where players can design tricks for everyone to try, makes freestyle more accessible for average defrag runners that might not be so creative, and gives those creative players another reason to keep designing jumps and build a community around this mode.
