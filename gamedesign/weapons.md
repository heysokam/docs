## Grappling hook
- Cool because it opens up possibilities from pulling you.
- Not cool because it limits your direction to the point you grappled (removes strafing altogether while grappled)

## Implosion vs explosion (pull-push)
- All weapons work with explosions (pushing you away from the point of impact). 
- Implosion weeballs are cool in that they invert the direction, and you have to aim forward. Same with grappling hook.
- Instead of pushing (explosion) these weapons pull (implosion)
  - Rockets are slower, but push you more distance.
  - Plasma is faster, but pushes you less.
  - _Something else unique for implosion_

### Implosion Weapon:
- Slower rate than rockets, but pulls you more than rockets push you
- Creates an area of effect that stays for X time
  - The area pulls you into its center, launching you forward with its pull.
  - The area can only be shooted at solid surfaces (walls, floors, etc)
  - The farther you land from the center, the stronger the pull (like conc grenades, but inverted)
  - Allows to pre-shoot X amount of them to create a chainable effect (probably 2? maybe 3)
    - Could be abused by just firing them close to each other, and easily getting the multiplied power.
- These mechanics make the weapon behave in such a way that you have to predict where you are going to land AND how much farther you are going to go with the area-launch-acceleration plus your added strafing power.

## Pickup / powerup / consumable
### On demand slide
- Each charge gives you X seconds of sliding in any surface.

### Wall jump
- Similar to warsow's walljump, but limited with charges/ammunition.

### Dash
- Diabotical's Dash/Boost, but limited charges/ammunition.

### Air double-jump
- Airjump. TF2-Scout double-jump, but limited charges/ammunition

### Other weapons:
Source weapons as pickup on defrag:
- Conc grenades 
- Sticky launcher
- TF2 Rocket launcher
  - Difference: It needs reloading, and knockback physics work differently
  - _Could keep crouch jumping/etc for 1:1 replication_
