## FPS Speedrunning Sandbox
Sandbox where you can craft your own speedrunning physics and movement styles.  

Most games give you very specific movement features that you cannot change.  
Very understandable in the context of a competitive and reliable ruleset.  

Sandboxed movement takes a very different approach.  

Instead of hardcoding a predetermined strict set of styles,  
it divides each mechanic into a list of configuration values,  
and gives you the ability to change anything you want.
